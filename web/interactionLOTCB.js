One day the children were playing along the edge of the woods when they heard a weird sound. They were both intreagued by the sound and wanted to investigate it, but the young boy... let's call him Fredriche, remember that his mother told him never to enter the woods. No matter what! < We have to see what that sound was! > said the girl, lets call her, ummm, Gilbana. The boy warned her of the dangers that his mom described. He said there were terrifying creatures like skols and spiders, and beasts that might tear little children limb from limb. The girl was not worried by this and so as to prove that he was no coward the boy offered to accompany the girl into the woods despite the dangers that awaited them. The deeper into the woods the children went, the louder the sound became as if it was beckoning them nearer. Soon enough they came across a pile of sticks. The children took the sticks to use as swords and they continued bravely. Next the children found a large spiderweb that spread across the woodland floor. They found the web in the most peculiar of ways, Gilbana had stepped right into it and fallen over. The more she struggled in the web, the more stuck she became. It wasn't long before giant etna spiders came crawling close with acidic foam dripping from each of their fanged mouths. They scurried forth to drain Gilbana dry of her blood, but as they drew near her brother defender her fiercely brandishing the sticks they had collected earlier. Soon enough he had poked out all of the spiders beady eyes. with the sticks. He helped his sister out of the web and they continued deeper into the woods. Next they came across a pile of rocks. They took the rocks just in case they might come in handy later on. After following the strange sound even deeper into the dark woods that were now only illuminated by the light of the moon, they came across a snarling pack of skols. One large Skol grabbed Fredriche  by his boot and began to drag him away to eat as a snack. Gilbana threw one of the heavy rocks the children had found earlier and it hit the Skol right between the eyes. It fell over dead releasing the boys leg from its jaws. She threw the rest of the rocks at the rest of the pack and they ran away. Finally the children came across a glowing white light in the woods. The light it seemed was the source of the sound, It had long black eyes and a twisted black smile. It reached out as if to embrace the children but within a moment had grabbed them each in one of its giant hands and toar them limb from limb eating their flesh as it spilled. The End! The moral of the story is to never go into the woods... that is I mean, if you want to live.");

Thievery is wrong and I agree that it is a crime punishable by death. However, unlike those still loyal to the empire I offer those that have stolen from the populous a chance to abandon the wealth that they have unfairly hoarded at the expense of the people. If they refuse to submit the stolen goods then killing them is just, as they have committed the crime of thievery. You see, the imperial monarchy has convinced everyone that stealing is when a poor person takes from a rich person. It is not. True thievery is when a greedy person deprives another person of their basic right to live with dignity.");

He is a beast, not a man... I have to admit I want him dead more than anyone else. I knew that fool before he betrayed the imperial crown. He was married to my sister... but now... now because of him she was burnt at the pyre... They would have spared her if that beast had turned himself in. As I see it... That brigand Barraco Kein killed her himself. So... if you take on this bounty... and live, I will pay you double. Half from my own expense.");
