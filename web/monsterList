//TO BE ADDED INTO THE CODE
Deth - An intelligent, sentient goblinoid that lives in the vardanian grey grass plains: They construct villages, war with one another, celebrate with dances, develop technologies medical, architectural and militaristic, they hunt and gather food and supplies, and they have a hierarchical tribal system that includes a chief and a shaman.
RiodBeetle - A small red desert beetle that's flesh can be eaten raw or fermented and eaten as a semi alcoholic sour mash. It lives in the northern part of the burning desert. They will attack when in a swarm of four or more, but will otherwise run away.
Mummy - A cursed Zetian dead. The Zetians wrap their dead to preserve their body for the afterlife, but one of these preserved bodies is reanimated with a demonic curse.
Scorpion - A giant black scorpion that can be found in many desert biomes.
WhipScorpion - A giant whip scorpion that is native to the burning sands; they can be mounted and ridden, but Zetians are much more experienced at taming them than most other humans are.
Voaii - A giant red locust species that comes in several forms: winged locust, wingless crawler, and when it is a baby, it is a little grub. They lay their eggs in the stomach of their target. They leave their target alive and eventually that fertilized target pukes out the grubs along with blood since the grubs usually start feeding slightly on the stomach lining.
Barbol - A giant bearded dragon that is native to many different desert biomes.
DesertLizard - A small reddish bearded dragon native to the burning red sands.
Yag - A ginormous desert dwelling mammal that sifts the sand for insects to munch on. They are lazy and do not seek out larger prey unless they are particularly hungry, or are bothered and are acting in self defence. "A snack in self defence..."
Druog - A slim flying black serpent that has pointed venom tipped scales and spines, a particularly venomous bite, and that (if female) lays venomous spiny eggs to protect their young.
Shril - A south sea dwelling crustacean that has a toxic punch to its bite for which it has slender but long pointed fangs in rows in a mouth that barely fits them all.
Xerocole - A strange camel native to the burning red sands. Their necks are made out of a special type of cartilage that can easily break and almost instantly repair itself, this allows the xerocole to turn its head around in circles endlessly with no need to turn it back. Xerocoles are very friendly, they lick passersby to eat bugs off of them or just to taste their skin. Xerocoles love eating bugs.
Rattler - A type of snake that has a special part at the end of its tail that it shakes to produce a loud rattling sound. It makes this sound to scare potential predators away; if you near it despite its warning it will strike you with its venomous fangs.
Skindler - Also known as 'bloat head'; it is a Thengan sewer dwelling beast that feeds on excrement and flesh; it releases a gas that putrefies organic matter so as to digest it more easily; it has a single orifice through which it eats and excretes its waste (it is on its lower end); its head, or at least what would commonly be mistaken for its head, is actually a fleshy stomach bag.
Leshy - [in plural they are known as Leshen] A powerful malevolent (from many a human perspective) nature spirit that protects (in a manner of speaking) the balance of nature. It can summon shadow crows, it can summon living thorny vines around itself, and in the rare instance where a human cannibal is in its proximity it can create a Wendigo with a powerful curse. They make bone circle arrangements around the woods (Wendigo Circles)... they have two hearts (one inside of them and one outside of them) The carnal heart inside of them is vulnerable only after the heart of nature is destroyed, that is to say... it hides its secondary external beating heart of nature in the woods, and until it is destroyed, the Leshy has more powerful magics and is physically invincible.

Humpties' connective cord known as the chalaza holds this magical compound inside of it. In terms of behavior, humpties are just like humans (for they were magically evolved from humans). They talk, walk, drink, fight, craft, laugh, joke, tease... etc. However, humpty reproduction is completely inhuman. They reproduce by kissing and then later the female spits out a baby humpty (from her mouth).  //ArtificialIntelligenceAccess.push(new Unit(3600, 2500, "Person", false, "Mr. Dumpty", {race: "Humpty", faction: "Cephrite", personality: "violent", outfit: ["none", 8], weapon: ["none", [3, 2], 3, 22, 2], ranged: [false, "arrow", 1, 2000, 1, 6, 0, "none", 1.25], patrolStops: 0, patrolLoop: false, route:[[0, 0], [0, 0]], kid: true, kidSize: 2})); //ArtificialIntelligenceAccess.push(new Unit(3400, 2500, "Soldier", false, "Mrs. Dumpty", {race: "Humpty", faction: "Cephrite", con: 5, speed: 0.85, outfit: ["none", 9], weapon: ["none", [3, 3], 3.5, 25, 2], ranged: [false, "arrow", 8, 2000, 1, 6, 0, "none", 1.25], patrolStops: 0, patrolLoop: false, route:[[0, 0], [0, 0]], kid: true, kidSize: 2.1}));
