Humpties' connective cord known as the chalaza holds this magical compound inside of it. In terms of behavior, humpties are just like humans (for they were magically evolved from humans).

They reproduce by kissing and then later the female spits out a baby humpty (from her mouth).  //ArtificialIntelligenceAccess.push(new Unit(3600, 2500, "Person", false, "Mr. Dumpty", {race: "Humpty", faction: "Cephrite", personality: "violent", outfit: ["none", 8], weapon: ["none", [3, 2], 3, 22, 2], ranged: [false, "arrow", 1, 2000, 1, 6, 0, "none", 1.25], patrolStops: 0, patrolLoop: false, route:[[0, 0], [0, 0]], kid: true, kidSize: 2})); //ArtificialIntelligenceAccess.push(new Unit(3400, 2500, "Soldier", false, "Mrs. Dumpty", {race: "Humpty", faction: "Cephrite", con: 5, speed: 0.85, outfit: ["none", 9], weapon: ["none", [3, 3], 3.5, 25, 2], ranged: [false, "arrow", 8, 2000, 1, 6, 0, "none", 1.25], patrolStops: 0, patrolLoop: false, route:[[0, 0], [0, 0]], kid: true, kidSize: 2.1}));
