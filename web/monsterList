//TO BE ADDED INTO THE CODE
Deth - An intelligent, sentient goblinoid that lives in the vardanian grey grass plains: They construct villages, war with one another, celebrate with dances, develop technologies: medical, architectural and militaristic; they hunt and gather food and supplies, and they have a hierarchical tribal system that includes a chief and a shaman.
Mummy - A cursed Zetian dead. The Zetians wrap their dead to preserve their body for the afterlife, but one of these preserved bodies is reanimated with a demonic curse.
Na'ag - Also known as the Sandswallower. A ginormous desert dwelling mammal that sifts the sand for insects to munch on. They are lazy and do not seek out larger prey unless they are particularly hungry, or are bothered and are acting in self defence. "A snack in self defence..."
Druog - A slim flying black serpent that has pointed venom tipped scales and spines, a particularly venomous bite, and that (if female) lays venomous spiny eggs to protect their young.
Shril - A south sea dwelling crustacean that has a toxic punch to its bite for which it has slender but long pointed fangs in rows in a mouth that barely fits them all.
Leshy - [in plural they are known as Leshen] A powerful malevolent (from many a human perspective) nature spirit that protects (in a manner of speaking) the balance of nature. It can summon shadow crows, it can summon living thorny vines around itself, and in the rare instance where a human cannibal is in its proximity it can create a Wendigo with a powerful curse. They make bone circle arrangements around the woods (Wendigo Circles)... they have two hearts (one inside of them and one outside of them) The carnal heart inside of them is vulnerable only after the heart of nature is destroyed, that is to say... it hides its secondary external beating heart of nature in the woods, and until it is destroyed, the Leshy has more powerful magics and is physically invincible.
Shushken - A demonic creature that becomes petrified when gazed upon, and returns to flesh when it is not being observed. They excrete a white gummy substance that takes over human flesh and turns it into a hive for its eggs. They are only known to make nests in humans. All else they view as food.
Bleeder - A cursed spider-like being that inherently produces human flesh as its web, its own flesh is in fact human flesh. They are constantly suffering and their only way to react to that suffering is to exact their pain unto others by horribly mutilating them and torturing them to death. Bleeders steal human babies and raise them into new bleeders in their bloody pit nests.
    //INCOMPLETE BUT IN PROGRESS
Drake - The descendents of dragons: drakes have evolved differently than the parent species of dragons, they have only two legs rather than four, and they use their wings as arms when they walk. Drakes are nowhere near as magical as dragons are: while dragons are sentient and able to control the forces of magic, drakes have devolved overtime into wild beasts that mindlessly covet wealth and riches. Drakes are only magical in three ways: they communicate telepathically with those who have enough magic to listen, their bodies are magically resistant to dragon fire in all of its forms, and they can produce dragon fire that is expelled at will with tremendous force. Drake scales are hard to break, but they are nowhere near as impenitrable as dragon scales are. Drake bones are black, relavitely light weight, extremely durable, and completely hollow. Drakes, unlike dragons, are capable flyers and can stay in the air for a significant duration without tiring. Dragons cannot fly at all for they are much too heavy. Drakes are often times called Dragons by those who do not bother distinguishing between the various subspecies of dragons. With enough magical eminence or sheer beast handling expertise, a drake can be tamed, companionized, and ridden. Dragon fire is sticky like napalm and cannot be put out by water or a lack of fuel source as it burns using cosmic magical energy that not even repel spells can extinguish; it will burn out on its own eventually, but it will stick around for a while. Drakes are feared by all in the lands, for they have been known to ravage villages eat entire countrysides of livestock, melt down fortresses, steal treasure, and kidnap humans of rank as trophies of its conquest and domination.

They can fly, suck the lifeblood from their victims, and can carry enemies up into the air and let them fall to their doom. Vamprism is not spread with a bite, rather one must make a blood pact in order to become one. The only two ways to kill a vampire are to stake it through the heart with a silver stake, or to infect it with lycanthropy.

Taebjuur - A cartilaginous northern sea creature with several rows of overlapping sword sharp teeth. They are attracted to the smell of blood in the water and they love the taste of human flesh. They are extremely aggressive hunters and are unrelenting in the persuit of their prey. Killing is so instinctual for them that they will even hunt prey after they have just fed or are no longer hungry. They do it just for the thrill.
Pixi - A small winged bipedal fairy that has two arms it uses to cling onto its prey. Pixies are native to the Vardanian Hollows and the area around Blacklake in Cephrite. Pixies have a magical venom that causes their victim to desicate into a flakey papery husk. Pixies are extremely ravenous and can take around 5 bites per second. Pixies have dimensional magics that allow them to transport large pieces of the terrain whereever they wish (they do so as a means of messing with people and animals, but also because they find it amusing to deform the terrain around them). Pixies can be killed by ordinary means. Pixies are very chaotic creatures, they have a variety of moods that they switch between seemingly randomly: playful, lusty, social, and hungry. Female pixies are large and male pixies are small. The males fertilize the females which then allows the females to produce pixi dust. Pixi Dust contrary to popular myth does not allow you to fly, in truth consuming or inhaling it is extremely dangerous. Upon consuption/inhalation the imbiber feels elated and euphoric, but that is only because the pixi dust releases pixi growth enzymes that it needs to grow into pixi eggs. The pixi dust lodges itself along the esophagus and airway of the victim, or sometimes but less comonly in the host's pores, the dust quickly grow into lemon sized eggs. Once the eggs are mostly grown within the host new growth enzymes cause the host to develop an excess of saliva; the host coughs/chokes/spits/expels the growing eggs... during this process the hosts airway and esophagus are in most cases completely clogged with saliva lubricated pixi eggs, thusly the host often sufficates before their body can manage to expel the total amount of eggs within them. Once outside of the host the eggs complete their maturation and then hatch. Within each cluster of eggs between 1 and 9 pixies survive the hatching process.
Starfish - A pink starfish that lives along the south sea coastline. They eat small critters and bugs by expelling their stomach onto their victim.

Capul - A brown isopod distantly related to the desert dwelling armadii from an oceanic relative from the times when both the southern desert and the sourthern region of Vardania were below the ocean. This creature lives in the southernmost bogs of Vardania and hunts for bugs and weeds in the mud. Given their ancestral background they are ironically maladapted to water, their heavy shells cause them to sink quickly and drown. In fact, while most Isopods roll up into a ball to protect themselves from predators, capuls have had a history of being rolled into bodies of water by giant hungry salamanders whenever they curled up, so they have behaviorally adapted to avoid curling up.
Moderr - A dark shelled hollows dwelling creature akin to a lobster. They are immune to the flesh eating bacteria that make the water of the hollows black, and they occasionally use this environmental trait to their advantage by eating the remains of animals such as migrating birds that have the misfortune to land on the black water.
Tiger - A orange and black striped tiger native to the orgish bamboo jungles. They pounce on thier prey by lunging at them and tearing at them with there sharp claws.

Pig - An orgish variety of domestic swine that has a ravenous appetite and will eat just about anything remotely edible. They wander around in the muck looking for bugs and roots to eat when they are not stuffing their face with other food or napping.

Skarabaus - A fleshy beetle that's body is a symbiotic combination of a deadly, grey fungus and flesh. The beetle scurries about the hollows eating small insects, algaes, plants, and carrion. If a creature seeks to attack it, the skarabaus will deconstruct its body into a fleshy fungal outgrowth that releases grey spores that when inhaled cause their victim's body to fatigue severely by slowing their body's vital functions (this can cause cell death, and can be fatal).

Hyenas are more closely related to felines than to canines, but they are not either feline nor canine, rather they are their own family of creature called "Hyaenidae".
WildDog - A breed of wild dog that has a reddish brown coat of fur and lives primarily in the southern savannah region. They tend to hunt in groups of six, but can sometimes be found in a smaller group. They are fairly intelligent and each pack leader may devise their own hunting strategies. These dogs are particularly annoying as well because they bark almost all of the time!
Gazelle - A southern savanna inhabiting variety of deer-like quadruped, it feeds on grass and can run particularly fast.
Skriatok - An invisible body snatching fairy that is akin to a sprite. They pull living beings into alternate dimensions.
Wendigo - A powerful cursed being which primarily feasts on human flesh, they have long fangs and even longer claws. They can change between wendigo and human form at will. Wendigos are formed when a human consumes the flesh of another human (cannibalism) then either enters a trap set by a leshy (Woodland Spirit), or meets a leshy in person. Wendigos constantly face a ceaseless hunger that drags them in to a deep madness that drives them to kill. Wendigos do not like their curse: in order to get back at the spirit that cursed them they brutalize deer (which are Leshen's favorite protectee).
Cirmusid - An orange slime that is native to Thengaria; they live in filth and feed on detritus, they are happy to eat living creatures as well of course; their ooze has strong chemically mind altering effects (dizziness)
Skindler - Also known as 'bloat head'; it is a Thengan sewer dwelling beast that feeds on excrement and flesh; it releases a gas that putrefies organic matter so as to digest it more easily; it has a single orifice through which it eats and excretes its waste (it is on its lower end); its head, or at least what would commonly be mistaken for its head, is actually a fleshy stomach bag.
Sowt - An armoured tripedal creature that lives in sewage, muck, or waste (detritus dense zones) they feed on detritus as well as flesh. They produce a flem that hardens when it interacts with a compound they produce, the product is a number of long sharp brittle spikes that it propels towards its prey (the compounds that compose the flem are both venemous and poisonous). If it is far from its prey it charges directly forward, otherwise it moves in a zig zagging sort of crab walk towards its prey in order to confuse it.
Fegil - A Vardanian plains rodent that's males collect valuables to impress the females; the females scavenge dalger eggs, and they both feed their young pre-masticated food
GreyTroll - A monstrous woodland troll with grey fur. Grey trolls only hunt when they are hungry and they are particularly territorial about where they make their home.
Griffin - A lionesque raptor that uses its large wings to lunge into a glide towards its helpless prey; they are most commonly found in temperate grasslands but they can also be farther south in the cold seasons
Vodkapa - A burrowing boney swamp beast native to the swamplands of Vardania. When they are born one or two at a time their only priority is to find a place far away from their progenitor to bury themselves. They have a lot of genetic variety, but they are asexual self reproducing beings so their offspring are nearly identical genetic copies (most of their genetic variation is environmentally influenced). They leap from their mounds of mud and swamp foliage to stab to death and devour whatever ill fated creature wanders by, then they bury themselves in the foliage to repeat the cycle again. Vodkapas are extremely territorial and hostile, so much so that they will even kill their own adult offspring if they ever return to the nest (their offspring would just as soon kill them). The only exception to this extreme hostility is when they initially give birth, because they cannot yet smell their young as being any different from themselves (sort of like a discombobulated limb): they regard them as a part of themself until their offspring grow mature enough to develop their own distinct scent.
Chupacabras - A temperate plains dwelling beast that has supernatural speed, two long fangs for sucking blood, and that only hunts during the night. The pelt of a chupacabras is slightly heat resistant and extremely flexible, thusly the heat and tention produced by the beast's unnatural speeds leave no negative impact on it.
Rat - A small rodent that eats carrion; they are highly aggressive and confident when they form a group together, but when they are alone they are cautious. They group up in groups of 6, and 11 at the largest. They cling onto the flesh of their victims and scurry around then gnawing away mouthfuls of flesh from their living corpse.
GreyHorse - A grey variety of horse that is native to Vardania
Mornid - A grey slime native to Vardania that collects weapons and armour from the fallen and uses them for itself; it is a highly intelligent slime; it is relatively inert, it doesn not always produce acid or toxins as do most other slimes (it only produces acid to digest food when it needs to digest); they can be tamed; they are not particularly hostile, nor do they seek to increase their size, they only hunt as needed to maintain themselves or get more gear to wear as a shell or to use as weapons.
Gnoll - A goblinoid hyena species that hunt either alone or in small groups of up to six. They are extremely fast, agile and aggressive and will leap long distances onto their prey. They begin to eat their prey alive even before they have killed it, they grab onto it with their arms and legs and tear flesh off with their jaws. They are native to the southern savnannah of Cephrite. Gnolls has a sort of kinship with hyenas wherein the gnolls are the masters and the hyenas are their defacto guard dogs.
Angler - A large Vardanian Swamp dwelling amphibean that has an antennae that it pokes out above the surface of the murky swamp in order to look like the local stalked trubka plants; it hides below, waiting to pounce on any critter that passes it by unwittingly. They are distantly related to vodkapas and like vodkapas they reproduce asexually through a process of imperfect self cloning, but the two species have evolved in drastically different ways over the centuries: unlike vodkapas, anglers have developed gills for breathing underwater. The strength of a angler's jaw can crush bones.
Motylekh - An enormous forest dwelling moth that bludgeons its prey to death before sucking it dry of blood with its unfurled proboscis. If the motylekh is injured it shudders, releasing a silvery sparkling dust that causes its victim to become faint, weary, and delusional (in particular the feramones present on the motylekh cause a localized psychodelic response to the ingestion of the dust). As young they exist in a larval stage (wherein they are known as chervstrakha), they then seek to construct a web cocoon around themselves in preparation for their metamorphosis into their motylekh form. Their wings are a valuable material used for making clothing, bedding, and other such fineries: in order to utilize the wings for this purpose they must be clipped (debristled) and boiled (in order to remove psychodelic dust).
Pokinutyy - A Vardanian swamp arthropod that feasts on insects. They are very curious creatures that will investigate seemingly harmless creatures, but they are also social and will warn their friends of danger once it is encountered.
ShriekingBloodworm - A long black carnivorous worm that shrieks loudly both to communicate and to scare away predators. The females lay eggs in small holes and cover them with branches and twigs, the males fertalize the eggs externally once they are lain. After a bloodworm has eaten it bloats, which hinders its ability to move quickly. They are aquatic but can survive on land as well. They are native to the floodplain swamps of central - southern Vardania. They often lurk in shallow water waiting for prey to come near.
Varmin - A large rodent that is a not-so-distant relative of rats. They are like rats except that they do not form large groups, they tend to be very solitary, with the exception of their young. They are massive rodents. They live primarily underground and in the grasslands of southern Vardania.
Lyagushka - An amphibeous and carnivorous swamp creature that is native to the southern and central swamps of Vardania. They have Tadpolesque young that are solely aquatic. The males of the species are rich with colours in order to attract mates. Males of the species also excrete an oily faramone rich substance that coats their rough thick skin. They have six eyes and webbed feet...
BrainFlies - A type of fly that lives in the refuse of the Thengan sewage swamp north of Cranheim. They are aggressive and they will squeeze in through the gaps in one's armour in order to crawl into one's ears and lay eggs in their aural fluid. When the eggs hatch into maggots they travel to the brain and eat the brain tissue as sustenance. When mature they live in hives.
Xerocole - A strange camel native to the burning red sands. Their necks are made out of a special type of cartilage that can easily break and almost instantly repair itself, this allows the xerocole to turn its head around in circles endlessly with no need to turn it back. Xerocoles are very friendly, they lick passersby to eat bugs off of them or just to taste their skin. Xerocoles love eating bugs.
Scorpion - A black scorpion that can be found in many desert biomes. Scorpions range greatly in size, some are small, and others are gigantic.
WhipScorpion - A whip scorpion that is native to the burning sands; the medium sizes of them can be mounted and ridden, but Zetians are much more experienced at taming them than most other humans are. They range in size from small to gargantuan.
RaedBeetle - A small red desert beetle that's flesh can be eaten raw or fermented and eaten as a semi alcoholic sour mash. It lives in the northern part of the burning desert. They will attack only when the target looks weak or vulnerable, but will otherwise run away.
DesertLizard - A small reddish bearded dragon native to the burning red sands.
Rattler - A type of snake that has a special part at the end of its tail that it shakes to produce a loud rattling sound. It makes this sound to scare potential predators away; if you near it despite its warning it will strike you with its venomous fangs.
Barbol - A giant bearded dragon that is native to many different desert biomes. They are particularly lazy and do not like to move about much, but when they are hungry or mad they will persue their prey viciously.
Voaii - A giant red locust species that comes in several forms: winged locust, wingless crawler, and when it is a baby, it is a little grub. They lay their eggs in the stomach of their target. They leave their target alive and eventually that fertilized target pukes out the grubs along with blood since the grubs usually start feeding slightly on the stomach lining.
VoaiiYoung - A immature infant voaii grub, they are born from eggs lain inside the flesh of living hosts. The eggs when they hatch make their way to the stomach where they excrete an enzyme which causes the host to expel them orally. They grow into more mature stages of voaii.
Armadii - Giant orange shelled rolly polly bugs native to the Burning Sands. For defense the can curl up in their shell to avoid danger. Zetians ride them and use them to carry their belongings for travel through the desert.
Yilotnyy - A furry shelled mire-dwelling mammalian cross between a shellfish and an eel. They are amphibious. The males are smaller and have large teeth and strong jaws for hunting, while the females are much larger and spit a highly potent acidic flem to melt their prey before the chow down on the melted remains.
CrilmBug - A Vardanian mire beetle that feasts on the carrion of the bog.
