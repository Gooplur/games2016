House Blackwood was once a Vardanian house before Black Lake and the surrounding lands were taken from Vardania by Cephrite when Vardania tried to take land from Cephrite and was pushed back well past its old border. Since then the blackwoods who were granted mercy in exchange for fealty have only intermarried with Cephrians for hundreds of years, so their old Vardanian heritage is only very slight.
